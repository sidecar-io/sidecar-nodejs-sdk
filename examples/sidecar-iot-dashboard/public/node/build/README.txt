Sidecar Node.js Client

The open source Sidecar javascript client wraps the Sidecar REST API
and handles event ingestion, authentication and queries.

What is Sidecar?
----------------
Sidecar is a data platform purpose built to consume and analyze sensor-based
data streams so that the owners and developers of IoT hardware do not need to
be concerned with the large infrastructure and development overhead associated
with the long term persistence and meaningful computation of that data.

Once device data is stored in Sidecar, the platform is capable of:

- Returning the raw source data
- Generating Insights
- Propagating notifications that are executed based on rules defined by device owners
- Aggregation of inbound data sources
- Allowing developers to write interactive ad hoc queries whose results can be used
  in reporting web and mobile applications
